PLACEHOLDER FOR RESUME PDF

This file serves as a placeholder for your actual resume PDF.

To complete your website setup:
1. Replace this file with your actual resume PDF named "resume.pdf"
2. Update the links in config.json if you prefer to link to an external resume website
3. Update all contact information in config.json with your actual details

The resume link is configured in:
- config.json (contact.resume.url)
- index.html (multiple references to "assets/resume.pdf")

Make sure your resume PDF is:
- Professional and up-to-date
- Optimized for web viewing
- Named exactly "resume.pdf" (or update the config accordingly)
